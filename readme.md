# auto insurance database
## First Stage
Working on transfering data from netdisk to local data base. Data are mainly stored at csv, txt and sas7bdat format. Use postgresql as data base, use psycopg2 to interact with postgresql, use pandas to read sas7bdat file and to directly dump to postgresql. My harewares are kinda out of date, have to read and upload by chunk.
